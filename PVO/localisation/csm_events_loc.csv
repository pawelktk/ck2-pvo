EVTDESAcsmm.007;You have inherited some artifacts that seem to be related to mounts, as you don't possess a mount to make use of them they are useless to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.007;Sell one of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsmm.007;Sell them all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsmm.007;Keep them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.008;[From.GetBestName] has become unlanded, thus [From.GetSheHe] is unable to make use of [From.GetHerHis] mounts. [From.GetSheHeCap] has decided to give them to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.008;I will make good use of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.009;It seems your Stable Master [From.GetFirstName] has passed away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.009;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.011;Your [dying_mount.GetName] has sadly passed away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.011;Oh no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.012;It seems your [breeding_mount_1.GetName] has taken a liking to your [breeding_mount_2.GetName]. The two horses have produced an offspring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.012;Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsmm.012;The foal will take around 6 years to be rideable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.013;One of your foals has grown up enough to ride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.013;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.015;Unfortunately none of the nearby Heartlands can supply you with a [csm_bought_item.GetName]. Your money has been refunded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.015;I'll try later then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.017;The upkeep cost of your mounts will now be deducted.\nIf you disable this notification, the upkeep will still be deducted yearly. You will be asked again when you switch characters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.017;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsmm.017;Stop showing me this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x



EVTDESAcsmm.300;Hello and welcome to Crusader Mounts. The mod is now setting up and will be ready in one ingame week. If you have either CK2Plus or HIP installed, the mod will autodetect them and make any neccessary adjustments.\nIf you want more info on how some of the mechanics work, please pick the first option to get the info book. Other than console commands, this is your only chance to obtain it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.300;Give me knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsmm.300;I know enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.301;From here you can access more detailed information on all the mounts of the world, their care, and their uses.\nThere is a section on the Mount Heartlands as well, and another on Mounted Combat.\n\nThis book seems quite rare and is probably the only one in existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.301;Read about mounts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsmm.301;Read about the mount heartlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsmm.301;Read about mounted combat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESAcsmm.302;Mounts are divided into four types: Horses, Camels, Elephants, and Exotic.\nHorses are further categorized as Coursers, Destriers, and Chargers.\n Coursers are meant to be fast and light, while Chargers are slow and heavy, and Destriers being in between.\nA horse's type can be learned from either it's name, or by it's appearance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.302;More about obtaining mounts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsmm.302;More about lifespans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsmm.302;More about breeding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.303;Mounts are mainly obtained from the market decision, with more options appearing if you can reach the required provinces.\nThere are a couple of unique mounts obtained from various events, as well as decision to ask for a horse from China.\nThe last method is via breeding more horses yourself.\nMounts can also be sold with a self targeted decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.304;Each mount has a base health stat, usually five. Some harder to acquire mounts have six or seven.\nEvery two years all mounts have a 60% chance to lose one health. This can be lowered by the following factors: Being unique, having the Robust trait, and the ability of your Stable Master.\n Various events can also modify a mount's health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.305;Only non-unique horses can breed. As long as you have at least two horses that can breed. Every two years there is a chance they will produce an offspring, fertile horses increase that chance. Each horse can breed twice, fertile horses can breed thrice.\n The horses will pick their mate without human intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.305;More on breeding results;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.306;The resulting foal's type depends on the first horse's type, as in a Courser will never produce a Destrier or Charger. Then the foal's breed is picked, this depends on both horses' breeds, their origins, and sometimes their owner's culture or location.\nTraits have a chance to be inherited, with much higher chances if both parents have the same trait.\n The foal will age over six years until it is ridable and gains a bonus to it's base health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTTITLEcsmm.310;The Mount Heartlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAcsmm.310;These provinces act as the hub for all mount related trade in their regions. If a Heartland is empty, it cannot provide mounts or equipment to those nearby.\nIreland: [ireland_mount_province.GetName]                                            France: [france_mount_province.GetName]\nGermany: [germany_mount_province.GetName]                                          Slavic: [slavic_mount_province.GetName]\nItaly: [italy_mount_province.GetName]                                                    Spain: [spain_mount_province.GetName]\nAndalusia: [andalus_mount_province.GetName]                                     Steppes: [steppes_mount_province.GetName]\nArabia: [arabia_mount_province.GetName]                                                      Greece: [greece_mount_province.GetName]\nBactria: [bactria_mount_province.GetName]                                                    India: [india_mount_province.GetName]\nAfrica: [africa_mount_province.GetName]                                                       Tibet: [tibet_mount_province.GetName]\nScandinavia: [scandinavia_mount_province.GetName]                                Russia: [russia_mount_province.GetName]\nSoumi: [sami_mount_province.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsmm.310;Read about the natural fluctuation of the Heartlands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsmm.311;The Heartland's resources fluctuate over time. Animals die, craftsmen create more equipment, the area is looted, many things change the area's conditions.\nThe more prosperous the province, as well as the existence of various festivals and craftsmen will increase the Heartland's resources over time.\nOn the other hand, disease, depopulation, sieges, bandits and other nefarious organizations work to harm the resources present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTTITLEcsmm.320;Mounted Combat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAcsmm.320;Combat may occur when a mounted character enters a battle. Chances are increased for warlike characters.\n The tactics available to you depend on your current mount, if you can use horse archery, your opponents mount, and sometimes the terrain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEcsm.203;Bucephalus Tamed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAcsm.203;You climb up the horse and after a few moments of thrashing about he finally calms down. The crowd erupts into cheers celebrating your success. You now have a mighty horse under your command, sure to draw the admiration and envy of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESBcsm.203;Word has reached you that [From.GetTitledName] has successfully tamed Bucephalus. [From.GetSheHeCap] now has a mighty horse under [From.GetHerHis] command, sure to draw the admiration and envy of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.203;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.203;Damn [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEcsm.204;Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAcsm.204;Bucephalus immediately throws you off. The beast grunts towards you as you back away in shame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.204;Damned horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESAcsm.206;While playing outside you hear the faint sound of animals. As you search for them you remember that [current_guardian.GetFirstName] has some mounts in the stables. Maybe [current_guardian.GetSheHe] might let you see them for a bit?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.206;I'll go ask [current_guardian.GetHerHim] right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.206;But what if [current_guardian.GetSheHe] gets mad at me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.207;One of your [GetFromRelation]s runs up to you all excited. After [From.GetSheHe] calms down a bit [From.GetSheHe] asks if you could show [From.GetHerHim] your mounts in the stables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.207;Well why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsm.207;§Y[From.GetFirstName]§! might gain a §Gpleasant§! trait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.207;Go away, I'm busy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBcsm.207;§Y[From.GetFirstName]§! might gain a §Rselfish§! trait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.208;[From.GetFirstName] smiles and leads you towards the stables. You were able to see a [random_mount.GetName] while it was eating. After a while you both leave in happiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESBcsm.208;[From.GetFirstName] shoos you away. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that [From.GetSheHe] has no time to entertain children and that you should go bother someone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.208;That was really fun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.208;What a meanie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.210;During the Siege of [FromFrom.GetName] by [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] men, the stables were hit by the falling rubble. Your [hurt_mount.GetName] was injured in the chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.210;Curse them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.211;During the chaos of battle, a stray arrow hits your [current_mount.GetMountType]'s side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.211;Curses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.212;While you huddle in the safety of your castle, you remember the animals stuck in the stables. The epidemic will surely affect them if you do nothing. You could bring a couple of them inside the castle, but risk infection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.212;Get them here before they die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsm.212;will get infected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.212;Our lives are much more valuable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTTITLEcsm.214;The Heavenly Steed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESAcsm.214;In the late hours of the night as you sit secluded in your prayers, you hear a commotion coming from outside. You leave castle and wander around outside, noting that for some reason nobody is around, not even the guards.\nFinally you find the source, it's coming from the stables.\nWhen you enter you see a strange sight, a horse that was never there before. It's a beautiful white arabian horse, but what's stranger is that you feel a soothing sense of peace whenever you look at it. One thing is certain, this horse is not of this world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.214;A truly amazing creature;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.301;Recently there has been an influx of traders in [Root.GetName]. This has resulted in higher profits for the locals and thus to you, their liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.301;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.302;Recently there has been an influx of traders in [Root.GetName] due to the presence of a trade post. This has resulted in higher profits for the locals and thus to you, their liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.302;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.303;A group of craftsmen have arrived in your lands seeking fortune. They are quite skilled, especially in the creation of mount equipment but require some funds in order to get the tools they need. Sponsoring them would bring mutual benefits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.303;Sounds great;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.303;Not interested;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.304;The current group of doctors from the Hospital of [From.GetName] have proven themselves extremely skilled and efficient. There are barely any sick patients left, allowing them to instead tend to the traders passing through the province.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.304;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.305;The local traders have come to see you with an offer. If you would lend them some of your personal land for them to graze the horses, they would give you a small cut of their profits from their future sales.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.305;Sounds good to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.305;Absolutely not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.307;As you look upon your lands, you think up of various methods to increase it's overall wealth. Since [Root.GetName] is considered a Mount Heartlands, perhaps you could take advantage of that. Nothing says fun like horse races. If you organized some you could draw more foreign traders to your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.307;Let us begin preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.307;That's too expensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

###############Character Flavor Tombola Events###############


EVTDESAcsm.401;It has come to your attention that you have run out of food for your [random_mount.GetName]. This could be a chance for you to improve your [random_mount.GetMountType]'s health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.401;Get some quality feed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.401;Something decent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsm.401;Don't bother me with such trifles, anything is fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.402;Due to the rigorious training and care from [stable_master.GetBestName], one of your mounts has improved to a point where it has gained a new trait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.402;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsm.402;Will gain a random trait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.403;Always on the move, nomadic life is difficult but that is what makes true men. Your faithful [improved_horse.GetName] has gotten used to running long distances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.403;Speed is always good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsm.403;will become §GSwift§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.404;You've been blessed with a few hours of peace. As you stroll about your halls, you wonder if you should perhaps take one of your [random_mount.GetMountType]s on a ride, but where to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.404;A leisurely ride around my lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.404;I think I'll go hunting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsm.404;Maybe not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.405;Stable Master [stable_master.GetFirstName] has been working very hard over the years he's been serving you. Today he tells you that all the mounts in your stable are showing signs of increasingly good health. After taking a look for yourself, it's clear that it's all from [stable_master.GetFirstName]'s tireless efforts. Surely he deserves a reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.405;That's amazing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.406;As you lounge by the window, you start hearing the sounds of two people yelling. You take a peak outside and see both [stable_master.GetFirstName] and [stable_master_arguement_courtier.GetBestName] in a heated arguement. The two are almost at each other's throats, and not to mention disturbing their [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.406;Now now, we're all friends here;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.406;I command you to be silent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsm.406;It'll be over soon, no need for my involvement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.407;While preparing your mount, you notice that it's armor has become dented and weak. You should probably repair it before it becomes unusable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.407;Time to find a smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.407;It's too expensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.408;A fire has broken out in the stables! Some of your mounts have been hurt by the flames;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.408;Curses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESAcsm.409;Stable Master [stable_master.GetFirstName] has come to you with several specialized training schedules for your [improved_mount.GetName]. He says that all of them include a special diet and care that will improve the [improved_mount.GetMountType]'s lifespan as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcsm.409;I want it to turn heads wherever it goes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAcsm.409;[This.GetName] will become §ZFair§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcsm.409;Make it strong and hardy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBcsm.409;[This.GetName] will become §ZRobust§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCcsm.409;Let it crush all who stand in it's way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCcsm.409;[This.GetName] will become §ZPowerful§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDcsm.409;Have it outrun anything that chases it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPDcsm.409;[This.GetName] will become §ZSwift§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
