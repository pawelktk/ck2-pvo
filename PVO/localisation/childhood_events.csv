EVTDESC_puer.1001;You've been spending a lot of time  with [chosen_child.GetFirstName] and your relationship has started to grow. This blissful period is interrupted when your regent tells you that nobles are not supposed to marry peasants. How will you deal with this news?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1001;I don't care, I want to marry [chosen_child.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1001;Marriage isn't the only relationship...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1001;I'm sorry [chosen_child.GetFirstName], we need to see other people;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1003;As you're growing up, you notice that the other children have an easier time reading than you.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1003;I really want to read like them!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1003;Who needs books anyway...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1004;As you're growing up, you notice that you are better at reading than the other children.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1004;I'll spend all my day reading!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1004;Books are nice but I'd rather play outside;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1005;The two child armies face each other and your company charges at your command. You emerge victorious from the struggle and celebrate your victory;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1005;Good battle everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1005;No mercy for the vanquished!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1006;[chosen_child.GetFirstName] invites you to the garden to play physician. You've started gathering leeches but, when [chosen_child.GetSheHe] disrobes, you realize what [chosen_child.GetSheHe] really meant.;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1006;Oh so THAT's what it looks like!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1006;This is not for me at all;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1007;You receive news that one of your playmates has been taken by a terrible disease. No longer will you run and play with them in the fields...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1007;Why must the world be so cruel?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1007;I'm sure they're in a better place now;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1008;Your health has steadily deteriorated and you feel yourself burning up. This is a common disease among children and it leaves some permanently debilitated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1008;I will stay in bed and recover;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1008;I should really get some fresh air;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1009;You've been reading a lot lately and you've taken up the protagonist of many stories as your hero. What makes them so wonderful?;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1009;They were a great leader;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1009;They were a great conqueror;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1009;They were a great thinker;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_puer.1009;They were a great lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1010;You and your friends have gathered in the courtyard when one of the older children catches a younger one stealing his pastry. As the lord you must decide what his fate will be;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1010;Punish the theft with a beating;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1010;He's only a little kid, he didn't know any better;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1011;It appears your nurse has found some young animals and is asking you if you would like one as a pet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1011;I want the kitty!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1011;I want the puppy!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1011;I want the birdie!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1012;After many years of friendship, your dear pet has finally left you. You bury them in the garden as you fondly remember your time together;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1012;Life is hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1013;By pushing around the other children, you have become known as the strongest and most fearsome of your circle. Despite this, you hear that some of the weaker children resent your methods;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1013;They shouldn't whine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1013;Maybe I should try being nicer to people;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1014;[chosen_child.GetFirstName] has been pushing you around and finding ways to make your life miserable at every turn. You want to give [chosen_child.GetHerHim] a piece of your mind but you're worried you might end up worse for wear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1014;I'm not afraid of you!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1014;Actually I am quite scared;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1015;Now that you are nearing adulthood, your regent has decided that you should learn the proper skills of a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1015;I can't wait for the next lesson;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1015;I'd rather be out with my friends;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1016;Despite you nearing adulthood, your regent has yet to teach you anything about ruling. This all sounds very suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1016;I don't need lessons, I can do other things;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1016;I will study governance hidden;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1017;Your regent has introduced you to [chosen_child.GetFirstName] and has now suggested that you two should marry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1017;Sure! She seems nice;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1017;I decide who I should marry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1018;Your regent has been spending a lot of time around [relative_spouse.GetDynName] covering her with gifts and flatteries. Now he comes to you asking for [relative_spouse.GetFirstName]'s hand in marriage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1018;This sounds like a fine union!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1018;This feels wrong;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1019;The stablemaster shows you a fine pony and lifts you on. It's time that you learned how to ride!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1019;Faster!Go faster!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1019;I'll get my bearings first;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1020;You've noticed that the people of your capital have different customs to yours. What do you make of them?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1020;I like their ways very much;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1020;My traditions are better;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1021;You've noticed that the people of your capital have a different religion from you. What do you make of their practices?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1021;They make a lot of sense;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1021;Sounds like the sort of thing peasants would believe;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1022;You've tried time and time again to meet new people but to no avail. It looks like nobody wants to be friends with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1022;Who needs friends anyway?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1022;I have to keep trying;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1023;Your noble upbringing doesn't give you many chances to be with children your age and you've started to feel more and more lonely;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1023;I just need to learn how to be on my own;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1023;I should really find someone my age;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1024;Now that you are nearing adulthood, you feel that you should start taking different responsibilities from your regent;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1024;I will show everyone what I can do!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1024;I still have a lot to learn;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1025;Now that you are nearing adulthood, you feel that you should start taking power from your regent and rule your realm in your own right;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1025;My reign begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1025;Actually, they've been doing a good job;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1026;Now that you are nearing adulthood, you feel that you should start asking for oaths of fealty from your vassals and rule your realm in your own right;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1026;My reign begins!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1026;They look loyal enough;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1027;One day, while taking a walk around your home, you notice that some children just like you are being beaten for stealing some food. It's the first time you've ever seen someone so thin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1027;Here, you can have some of my food;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1027;It's their fault they're poor;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1028;Your regent reminds you that he has served you and your predecessor faithfully for a long time. He now asks you for a landed title that he might pass on to his own heirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1028;You've earned this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1028;I'm not giving away one of my titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1029;As the lord you naturally have all the best toys and all the other children look enviously at them. One of them finally dares to ask if he might play with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1029;Get your own toys!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1029;Alright, we can share;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1030;[sibling_rival.GetFirstName] has really been getting on your nerves. They keep pestering you day after day and soon you will no longer be able to stand your sibling.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1030;I've had enough of you!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1030;I can't stay mad at you;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1031;You've begun to really appreciate [chosen_child.GetFirstName] and you can feel the beginning of a beautiful friendship;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1031;Friends forever?;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1031;They're not bad but...;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1032;You notice that people treat [bastard_child.GetFirstName] very differently from you. Your regent has explained to you that this is because [bastard_child.GetSheHe] is something called a "bastard" and are less legitimate than you are;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1032;Well I think you're great anyway;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1032;Oh, I understand why I'm better than you now;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1033;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very affectionate, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] is always looking for company and tries to make friends with whoever [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] meets;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1033;I wanna be like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1033;Why would anyone be like that?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1034;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very playful, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] is always running around the courtyard with [compare_sibling.GetHerHis] friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1035;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is quite haughty, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] is very confident of [compare_sibling.GetHerHis] superiority and enjoys bossing the servants around;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1036;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very rowdy, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] loves to play war and get in trouble with [compare_sibling.GetHerHis] friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1037;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very conscientious, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] never misses a chance to finish [compare_sibling.GetHerHis] chores and won't stop until everything is perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1038;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very fussy, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] always insists on having things be done exactly how [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] likes them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1039;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is quite brooding, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] doesn't like to play outside with the other children but prefers to ponder indoors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1040;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is quite indolent, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] doesn't like moving around much and prefers servants to do most of [compare_sibling.GetHerHis] chores;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1041;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very willful, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] is stubborn and rarely yields to anybody's point of view;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1042;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very curious, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] loves asking questions and constantly looks for explanations to the world around [compare_sibling.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1043;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is quite the idolizer, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] looks up to a lot of the adults and loves to fantasize about the stories they tell [compare_sibling.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1044;[compare_sibling.GetFirstName] is always very timid, [compare_sibling.GetSheHe] doesn't like to be around new people and tends to go along with what they say;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1045;You hear music coming from outside your room and then you see it. The carnival is in town! Dozens of sounds and smells and colors all crowd around your home and are just in reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1045;I can't wait to go there!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1045;This looks dumb;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1046;You've begun to notice all the scheming and conflict that surrounds you just as you get saddled with more and more responsibilities. Being a lord is not what you hoped it would be but you have to walk this path. Or do you?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1046;I have to do my duty;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1046;I can still enjoy ruling;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1046;Ruling means I'm free;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD_puer.1046;I prefer an anonymous but pleasant life;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1047;You are starting to become an adult and the reality of it all is falling upon you. Soon you will no longer be able to play all day but will be saddled with the burden of leadership;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1047;I will try be a child as much as I can;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1047;I will fight to fulfil my potential;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1048;Your imaginary friend visits you often and together you play for hours but now some people are suggesting you spend more time with your real friends;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1048;I want to go on an imaginary adventure!;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1048;Real people are more interesting than what I could dream up!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1049;Ever since you can remember, your faithful stuffed animal has been by your side but now your educator is suggesting that you leave it aside for more adult pursuits;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1049;No! Teddy is my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1049;I'm sure I can hide Teddy well enough;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1049;He's right, I'm a big [Root.GetBoyGirl] now;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1050;You've been spending a lot of time with [chosen_child.GetFirstName] and you realize that you are feeling something more than friendship. Are you going to confess this to [chosen_child.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1050;Hey, listen...;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1050;I'm sure these feelings will pass;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1051;You notice that, despite being the lord, people treat you worse than others. You've often overheard conversations about how they pity your physical appearance and the difficulties it gives you. How will you deal with this obstacle?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1051;I'll correct my deformity as best I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1051;I have nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1051;Someone similar will understand me;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1052;You notice that, despite being the lord, people treat you worse than others. You've often overheard conversations about how they pity your mental impairment and the difficulties it gives you. How will you deal with this obstacle?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1052;I'll overcome my difficulties as best I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1052;I have nothing to be ashamed of!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1052;Someone similar will understand me;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1053;You notice that people treat you better than others even if they don't know you're their lord. You've often overheard conversations about how they admire your natural beauty and the feats you could accomplish with it. How will you use this power?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_puer.1053;I'll take advantage of lesser people;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB_puer.1053;I'll help those less endowed;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC_puer.1053;Someone similar will understand me best;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_puer.1054;You notice that people treat you better than others even if they don't know you're their lord. You've often overheard conversations about how they admire your natural intelligence and the feats you could accomplish with it. How will you use this power?;;;;;;;;;;;;
